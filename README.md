# Taipei Half Marathon 2021
This code:
1. Scrapes the results for the 2021 Taipei Half Marathon from their <a href="https://www.sportsnet.org.tw/score_detail_utf8.php?Id=250" >website</a> and transforms the data into a useable form
2. Take a preliminary look at the data and looks for trends

# If you just want the data for your own analysis
Check out the data folder; I saved you the trouble of scrapping the marathon results :)

--------------------------
# To-Do
1. Make a Shiny interactive data visualization
2. Try to build a model to predict times
3. See if marathon runners run at a faster or slower pace than half-marathon runners
